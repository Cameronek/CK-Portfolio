5. Configure Git in Sublime Text
Some plugins like SublimeGit may require additional configuration. You can usually configure these plugins via Sublime Text's settings.

Open the command palette.
Type "Preferences: Package Settings" and select the relevant plugin (e.g., GitGutter or SublimeGit).
Configure the settings as needed.
6. Use Git Commands within Sublime Text
With the plugins installed, you can now use Git commands directly within Sublime Text. For example, with SublimeGit:

Open the command palette.
Type Git: to see available Git commands (like Git: Commit, Git: Push, etc.).
Additional Tips
Branch Management: Use the command palette to checkout, create, and manage branches.
Diff and Merge: Plugins like GitGutter show real-time diff in the editor, making it easy to see changes.
Commit and Push: Use the command palette to commit and push changes without leaving Sublime Text.
By following these steps, you should be able to seamlessly integrate and work with your GitHub repository in Sublime Text.
